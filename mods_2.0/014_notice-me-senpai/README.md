It is really hard to spot on vulcanus what are decorative rocks and what is coal, especially with that dark background.

This mod will show you which ore plots are under a drill, within drill range, as well as outside, when you hold a miner.

(just look at the thumbnail, there are 4 tiles of coal, do you notice which ones? hint: the top two are just decorations)

This mod currently does not update when you place a new drill or remove one, out of time right now so in an later version.
