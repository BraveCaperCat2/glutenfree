This is a fulgora centered port of https://mods.factorio.com/mod/se-interstellar-construction-requests-fulfillment

Colonizing an island that is out of logistic reach from other islands is a pain,
it feels like you're setting up a new planet from scratch each time, which can get a little annoying.

This mod will request missing construction materials on that planet in all of its hubs,
and once any of the hubs has the required items it'll teleport to the hub in the logistic network where the ghosts are.
