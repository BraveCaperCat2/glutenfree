A similar mod to https://mods.factorio.com/mod/notice-me-senpai, only for agricultural towers instead of mining drills.

It is very annoying the overgrowth soil reports as "seedable" whilst trying to find early game placement positions,
this mod draws green dots on tiles you can plant on now, yellow on those that require normal soil, and red for overgrowth.

The graphics are shit and headace inducing, so if you have some suggestions that i haven't yet tried i am all ears.
