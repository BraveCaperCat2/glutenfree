Made on request for use in custom racing competitions where the build time of the platform also matters.

Head into editor mode and grab yourself an infinity rocket silo and it'll fullfill any requests it can.

This initial version is fragile but stable, don't mess with the pole or circuit settings, and don't mind the rocket always being lit.

(the rocket always being lit is a wube bug)
(also, cargo bays and space platform tiles are prioritized, everything else just arrives in the order the game engine decides)
