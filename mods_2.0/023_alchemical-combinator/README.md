**This mod uses zero ups! everything is done with combinators on a hidden surface, only having it selected, closing its gui & copying from it use lua.**

Do you wish you could convert/map several signals into other signals all within one combinator? Well now you can!

Simply place the alchemical combinator and input on the left which signal to transmute and into what, the > = != < does not matter.

Signals that are not transmuted will pass right on through, signals that did get transmuted get filtered from the output side entirely.

What are some uses that come to mind? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the discussions.
