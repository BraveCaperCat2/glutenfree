During porting to 2.0 it was overlooked that trash slots on requesters and buffers need to be defined on the prototype,
until said mod has fixed it upstream this mod will add trash slots to all the container sizes that are expected to have them.

(please ping me when an aai containers update is released that adds native support, so i can deprecate this mod my players demanded)
