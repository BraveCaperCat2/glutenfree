This mod disables that filter blacklist texture, i have tried living with it but it is just getting under my skin.

Especially when you're setting whitelist filters by circuit wire on platforms and the moment there are no signals you get this ugly red thing.

Or in other words, this mod gives you the pre 2.0 visuals of whitelist/blacklist filters.
