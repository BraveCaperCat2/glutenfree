This mod adds a shortcut button with a compass that'll point to the demolisher that owns the territory you're in.

There is no territory api in 2.0.12 so this mod slowly tracks demolishers over time,
you might need to have this installed for a while in order for the compass to accurately point.

You can check the "ferromone trail" with `/demolisher-compass`, red chunks will point to their demolisher.
