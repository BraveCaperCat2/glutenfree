Spent quite litterally all day to get this to work, not used to gui stuff but i think i made it as smooth as vanilla-ish as possible to use.

This initial 1.0.0 version i deem stable, there is still performance and cleaner code to gain, but i'd like to publish this now and go to sleep.

I really do hope wube adds this natively, knowing how long the section of belt you're reading is makes it so much more easier to manage with circuits.
