Version: 0.0.7
Date: ????
  Info:
    - Pull the robot_order_queue into lua
    - Check for all networks, for all surfaces, for all forces, and profile it
    - Profile some more
    - Trigger a created event for new construction bots, so we won't need to check every network in existance
    - Improve performance by like a quadrillion that way
    - Attempt to optimize the if orders
    - Keep it simple and only check for the current order
    - Teleport robots once to where they came from when out of tasks
    - Hide the construction bots from the naked eye
    - Slow down the frames between building
    - Make construction robots wait until the scaffolding is up

Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2024. 11. 03
  Info:
    - Make the mod require space age/travel (for the platform construction animation)
    - Make the space platform build animations usable in luarendering
    - Animation offset my ass
    - Fix the animation offset being based on the current game tick
    - Cleanup the animation trial and error
    - Run the animation for each of the entity's tiles
    - Draw the appropriate piece based on the offset
    - Do not trigger on platforms
    - Use the correct render layers
    - Control the pacing of the animation entirely from lua
    - Move some magic numbers to constants
    - Attempt to animate the destruction nicely too
    - Animation frame is 0 based, so 32 would wrap around to frame 1
