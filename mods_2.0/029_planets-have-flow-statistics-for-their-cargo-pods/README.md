In remote view under planets and platforms you'll see a section called other,
clicking one one of those cargo pod entries you'll see a black surface you can press P on to open the production statistics.

This mod currently does not support planet prototypes getting renamed or given a different order, but for normal players this is of no concern.

Ideally wube will just add cargo sent/received to the production statistics of planets and platforms, for now make do with this mod and planets only.
