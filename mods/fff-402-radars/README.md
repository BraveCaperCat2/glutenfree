Connects radars on the same surface together.

Reskinned radars (e.g. Krastorio 2's advanced radar) should also work.

Disconnecting the circuit network if the radar lacks power is currently not implemented.

(nor do i really plan to add the power check, it will cost performance, and rail based wires don't go down without power either)
