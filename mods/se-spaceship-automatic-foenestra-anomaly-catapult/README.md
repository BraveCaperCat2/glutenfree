Cannot be bothered with making your own on-ship memory cell so a ship can travel without mounting on foenestra first?

This mod will make the ship use the slingshot if the source & destination are not in the same solar system.

Send a -1 anomaly signal to disable the mechanic for that ship, by default this is on for all ships.
