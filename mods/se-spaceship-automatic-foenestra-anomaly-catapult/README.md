Cannot be bothered with making your own on-ship memory cell so a ship can travel without mounting on foenestra first?

This mod will make the ship use the slingshot if the source & destination are not in the same solar system.

This mod expects you to set the destination signal through the clamp, whilst in flight sending a circuit signal breaks this simple mod.

if you manually set the destination of an in-flight spaceship you'll get a `slingshot disabled` message,
the mod will not re-activate until you de-anchor/launch from a non-anomaly surface again.
