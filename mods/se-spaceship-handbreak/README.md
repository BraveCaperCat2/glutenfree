Did i just spent several hours to write a mod that's effectively opening up a combinator and toggling on-off? yes.

On the map i currently play on we have scripts automated (why wouldn't we), but if you want to stop a ship for longer,
well then you'd have to toggle a combinator or disconnect a launch wire temporarily, whilst i'd rather just toggle a fuse.

Rotating it to the red position sends out a negative launch signal of 1, so sending more than 1 launch signal still causes a launch.
