Space Exploration's compatibility with Krastorio 2 adds basic matter stabilizers, this mod undoes that change.

It also undoes the matter deconversion nerf (imagine paying 2000 matter for a cube worth only 1000 :D)

Obviously this goes against the intended balance of their compatibility, but i'm used to this.
