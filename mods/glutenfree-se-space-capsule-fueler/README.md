When you are in orbit and would like to go down, you have 3 options:

- with a capsule
- with a cargo rocket
- with a space elevator

Sending a cargo rocket that isn't full yet is rather wasteful,
and the space elevator might not be built nor nearby.

So that leaves the capsule, either with emergency burn (massive inventory loss) or a fueled one.

I personally can't be bothered to have to input 50 ish rocket fuel each time by hand.
(heck, i have rocket fuel going to auto-trash and keep my jetpack fueled with AAI's)

Therefore i made this mod, when you open the gui the mod will read the amount & deliver it with construction robots.

The mod currently does not supply rocket sections, since honestly only be able to hop to adjacent surfaces is fairly useless, nor do i use it to propel myself to nauvis's orbit anyways.
