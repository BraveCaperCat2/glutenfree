Some people are fine with filling cargo rockets with (well) over 500k of rocket fuel,
this mod gives players a nudge to setup spaceships (or bunnyhop via foenestra) by locking the launch trigger.

This mod sets 400k as the default, this should be enough to launch to the anomaly and back (aka to match it), other notable limits:

- 230k, enough to launch to the anomaly from a 10k radius planet 
- 115k, enough to launch to any planet in the starting system (probably needs a number a little bit higher)
- 300k, neighbouring stars

Eh you get the drift, when you modify the number away from 400k please leave a comment saying why :)
