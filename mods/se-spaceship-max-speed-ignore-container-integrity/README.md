Its a little silly that in space the max speed (aka: drag) of a ship is determined by what's inside and not just by the outside.

This mod incentivizes small shuttles that are e.g. fueled by a steam tank and have no on-board ion stream decannister machines,
that was designing compact shuttles provides an incentive for high throughput routes, instead of being a complete waste of effort.

This mod ignores (aka, supports) the following:
- player placable containers
- player placable logistic containers
- player placable fluid tanks
- player placable booster tanks

Vehicles and anything else not listed above will still count towards the container integrity bar as normal.
(this mod functions by trying to get the container bar lower than the hull bar whilst a ship is in flight)
