When you loot a corpse via mining it inserts the items in order, which is a problem if you have more items than your body can hold without armor.

And since worn armor is typically last in the corpse it tries to pick that up last, which often resorts to many "inventory is full" messages.

This mod inserts the best* armor from the corpse into your armor slot (if its empty) before letting the game insert all the other items.

Thumbnail is a reference to Wolfenstein ET, where the first thing you do to a corpse is take its uniform.
