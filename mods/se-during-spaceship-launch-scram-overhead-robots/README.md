Lowers the chance that robots are flying over your spaceship during **automated** takeoff so they stay on their designated surface.

It will not 100% prevent bots from hitching a ride, but for those i suggest my other mod: [Space Exploration - spaceship juicebox](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/glutenfree-se-spaceship-juicebox)

- Are you a Space Exploration developer?
If so, please raise a built for the output inside Spaceship.update_output_combinator :)
