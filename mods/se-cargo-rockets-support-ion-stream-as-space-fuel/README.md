You can use ion stream to launch cargo rockets, the fuel value/ratio is the same as the launching of spaceships, which is a 2x increase over rocket fuel at the time of writing.

With this mod you can no longer pump fluids out of the progress bar of the cargo rocket silo.

Texturing the rocket (silo) to tint blue instead of orange would be nice but too hard right now.
