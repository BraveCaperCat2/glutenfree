If you cannot be bothered so send construction materials to planets via rockets or ships, this might be the mod for you.

The balance, if any, is that it takes a large amount of power for every single item you send,
so stuff you use en-masse like conveyors and inserters might still be worth sending via rocket.

This mod was developed/tested in a controlled environment on a pre-multi-planet SE save, performance issues and bugs can be expected.

(currently) not supported:
- curved rails
- modules & fuel requests
- tile ghosts
- no players online
- a "travel delay"
