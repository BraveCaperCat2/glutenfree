Marked as a cheat since knowing the generated chunk count (vs visible-to-your-force chunks) could provide an edge in rare pvp scenarios.

This mod is highly dependent on the universe explorer list layout at the time of release, it'll break or act weird if they move stuff around.

Note: this mod creates a very slight lagspike when opening the universe explorer since it has to resolve zone indexes to surface indexes.
