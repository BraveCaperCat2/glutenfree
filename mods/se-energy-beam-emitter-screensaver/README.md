Doubleclick on the laser preview window to ride it. (no you cannot actually steer it)

You'll also need to zoom in a bit by yourself in order to trigger the chunk to chart.

Thumbnail originates from the https://t.me/addstickers/Skavenzepto sticker pack on telegram.

Future version: perhaps just teleporting the remote view around each tick for each charting and no need for double clicking.
