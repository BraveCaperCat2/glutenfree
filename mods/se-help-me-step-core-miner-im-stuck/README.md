Core miners can get stuck if there are several connected to the same belt / mining productivity researches / downstream processing ratio issues / downstream processing catalyst ingredient issues / downstream outputs full / etc, this mod aims to alert you of planets/miners that require some player attention.

Note: this mod expects you to output core fragments into a normal/logistic container and not a belt, as shown on the mod thumbnail.
