Once you unlock foenestra its basically a shame to not use it when traveling to anything that's not adjacent to your home star.

Sure there are circuits for it, but eh dealing with the different destination zone types in a sort of memory cell is above my paygrade,
way easier for me to just write a mod that does it for me in good old lua, i prefer playing without any non-constant combinators on board.
