This mod currently causes all spaceships to show on top of the list if priority is the latest column you've filtered on.

Amongst the spaceship list they are only sorted by spaceship id (between the cyan brackets).

Clicking any column to sort or changing e.g. a row's priority returns it to default sorting until you re-open it again.

(note: yesyes, the mod's url still suggests it sorts by name within just its own priority number, but that was too complex for me rn)
