Current features:
- select an area to have those module requests fulfilled from any other entity on any surface. (and they get a ghost request)

Planned features:
- In case of lack of that level of modules, install lower level ones first and automatically/periodically upgrade to desired tier.
- Areas to prioritize for module stealing, currently it just steals it from whatever machine it'll first come across.
- Support for only stealing items from other surfaces when mods like `se-interstellar-construction-requests-fulfillment` are installed.
- Areas to blacklist for module stealing, like obviously your most precious setups should never be downgraded.
- Perhaps some way to not make it an instant teleportation.
