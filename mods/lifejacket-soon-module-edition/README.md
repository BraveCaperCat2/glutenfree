Usage:
1) Select an area using the new shortcut (wood icon)
2) Any module requests (item request proxies) wil be instantly fulfilled if those modules can be borrowed from machines elsewhere
3) entities within your current selection (albeit not highlighted) will not have their current modules stolen
4) entities that had their modules borrowed/stolen will receive their own blue triangle
5) enjoy your fresh/prioritized setup having all the modules it needs to do their job

Planned features:
- In case of lack of that level of modules, install lower level ones first and automatically/periodically upgrade to desired tier.
- Areas to prioritize for module stealing, currently it just steals it from whatever machine it'll first come across.
- Support for stealing items from other surfaces when mods like `se-interstellar-construction-requests-fulfillment` are installed.
- Areas to blacklist for module stealing, like obviously your most precious setups should never be downgraded.
- Perhaps some way to not make it an instant teleportation.
