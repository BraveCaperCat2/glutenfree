- i'm looking at you nuclear fuel ðŸ‘€
- could probably support trains with minimal modifications
- only works when a vehicle is both picked up and placed down again by a player, but cars aint blueprintable or deconstrucable anyways
- spidertrons are not supported currently either (not a car, again probably a quick modification, but only in e.g. k2 it uses fuel anyways)
