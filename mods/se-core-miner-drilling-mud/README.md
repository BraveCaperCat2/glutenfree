Based on reactions of the [Core Miner Refactor](https://discord.com/channels/419526714721566720/1144793340307570868) thread on the Earendel discord.

This mod boosts core miner output by 2.5x when you give a core mining drill some drilling mud.

Due to technical limitations you'll need to move the miner down by 1 tile in order to opt-in for drilling mud.

Multiplication factor, drilling fluid ingredients, crafting time/tints & basically everything is up for balance suggestions.

(note that this mod causes the numbers of my other mod (se-core-miner-output-helper) to not be accurate anymore, not marked incompatible)
