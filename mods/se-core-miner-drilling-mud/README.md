Based on reactions of the [Core Miner Refactor](https://discord.com/channels/419526714721566720/1144793340307570868) thread on the Earendel discord.

This mod boosts core miner output by 2.5x when you give a core mining drill some drilling mud.

Due to technical limitations you'll need to move the miner down by 1 tile in order to opt-in for drilling mud.
