[this mod but control stage and more powerful](https://github.com/Quezler/glutenfree/tree/main/mods/se-catalogues-can-be-crafted-from-their-breakdown)

Unlike Factorissimo 2 belts/pipes/chests up to the wall aren't a thing, interact with items via loaders or inserters, and fluids will need barrels.

- the files under `./graphics/` and their prototype defintions are MIT licenced to MagmaMcFry (original author) and notnotmelon (fork maintainer)
- parts of the control script (e.g. the `ingredients_to_factorissimo` button style/construction) come from Therenas's MIT licenced Factory Planner mod
