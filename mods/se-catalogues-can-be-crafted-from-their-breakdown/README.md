My playthroughs often stagnate due to no-one participating in the run bothering/caring to setup new science tiers since the ratios are mind-boggling.

This mod adds an alternative catalogue recipe in where you would just input the ~~raw~~ intermediate ingredients to get the same result.

Now i'm able to focus on growing my infrastructure and playing with techs i could already afford but without large setups.
