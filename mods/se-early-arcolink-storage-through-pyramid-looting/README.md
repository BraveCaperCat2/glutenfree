How far along it is in the tech tree + that arcospheres get voided by the recipe have never really caused me to be able to play around with it,
this mod makes the containers from each pyramid minable and function like arcochests, this mod also hides arcolinks from being researched at all.

Thumbnail is a nod to [this](https://youtu.be/Erp8IAUouus) video from CGP Grey, where something new yoinks onto something that shouldn't be used for it.
