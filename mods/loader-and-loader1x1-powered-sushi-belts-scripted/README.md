The miniloaders mod is not supported since those are actually inserters.

If a mod allows configurable container sizes (or you plan to add a mod that changes them) remove all sushi loaders first.

Only normal & logistic chests are supported, cargo wagons and assembling machine outputs are outside the scope of this mod.

Using sushi loaders on Space Exploration spaceships is not recommended to to there being no remote interface to whitelist entities.

Also, items with data (vehicles with equipment, blueprints, etc) will lose it if they pass through the loader, but who has those on belts.

NOTE: the timing to predict when the temporary inventory is empty is off and i currently cannot wrap my head around it, it has some performance impact.
