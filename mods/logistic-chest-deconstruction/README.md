Factorio tries to put deconstructed items in a storage chest that already has some of it, no matter how far across the surface that might be.

This mod allows construction bots to prioritize delivering deconstruction items to storage chest near your deconstruction site.

Ideally next to rails or other forms of bulk item transport so you can still get them to your main storage site.

The intended way to use this mod is to only have one storage chest marked for deconstruction per deconstruction site,
if its not large enough to (temporarily) hold all your items you are encouraged to use loaders/inserters to move it into other chests.

This mod loops all the marked storage chests on a surface each time a robot picks up items in order to find the closest chest. `O(n)`
It is for this reason you are encouraged to use a really big storage chest (like an aai warehouse) or offload into normal chests,
letting items sit in these chests by only extracting from them via construction/logistic bots when they're needed is discouraged.
