Factorio tries to put deconstructed items in a storage chest that already has some of it, no matter how far across the surface that might be.

This mod allows construction bots to prioritize delivering deconstruction items to storage chest near your deconstruction site.

Ideally next to rails or other forms of bulk item transport so you can still get them to your main storage site.
