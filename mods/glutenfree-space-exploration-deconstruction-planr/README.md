Currently you cannot deconstruct tiles that support entities, so you would have to first get rid of all the entities on that tile.

This mod remembers which entities you've marked for deconstruction with the gray deconstruction planner from this mod,
and when those get deconstructed it'll mark the tiles that were under it (and in your initial selection) for deconstruction.

But be warned: this mod has **no** undo/redo support, so be careful with what areas you select with it.
(though you can use alt mode of either deconstruction planner to cancel it before the bots arrive)
