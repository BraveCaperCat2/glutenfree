When a tank gets picked up it remembers the fluid name, amount & temperature, which gets restored upon placing the tank down again.

Ideal for when you need to launch an ion ship from a planet/moon to orbit, or when you misjudged how much fuel was needed to launch.

Being able to bring full booster tanks along ofc breaks balance, my mod cannot do much more than make those tanks unstackable.

Due to technical limitations this only works when mined/placed by either a player or construction robot.
(mods like repair turrets, construction drones & blueprint shotgun are unable to communicate pre-mined and which items got used)
