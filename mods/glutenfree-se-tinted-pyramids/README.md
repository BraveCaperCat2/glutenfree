I initially set out to create a mod that would allow you to re-enter already entered pyramids with satelite mode in case you'd want to look at the glyphs on the ground when you decide to solve the puzzle, and not have to preemptively screenshot all of them constantly.

Unfortunately that attempt has failed, but i could salvage some of that mod's code to reuse for this one.

This mod will cause the pyramids to be tinted in the color of the tier 9 module they (still) contain,
it could (read: is) considered cheaty to know which module will be in a temple before you even head to that planet.

However, in multiplayer it might be valuable to know which pyramids have already been looted.
(looted pyramids revert back to the default color, also: this mod can always be safely removed)
