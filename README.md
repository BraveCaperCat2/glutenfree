## Hacktoberfest

Hello fellow coder, i have had the pleasure of recieving 3 shirts to-date, gonna try and get my 4th this year, but with the repository requiring the `hacktoberfest` topic or pr's manually being assigned `hacktoberfest-accepted` it has become a little trickier.

While giving this repository itself the `hacktoberfest` topic won't directly cause me to receive a shirt, it might help some others to reach their goal. (rip shirt)

In this repository you will be able (if you so choose) to contribute on factorio mods, above beginner knowledge of factorio modding is recommended.

Issues i could use help with will have the `Help wanted` label attached to them, if you resolve them well enough it'll be merged and be one of the 4 you'll need.

I will not be marking any serious/reasonable attempts as spam, but sending pr's for minor and/or unsolicited stuff might, up to my discretion.

<sub>(ps, these are things i can do myself but haven't gotten to it yet, but i wished to give any factorio hacktoberfest contributors a chance for a shirt)</sub>
